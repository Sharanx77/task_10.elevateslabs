# 🦁 Sigma Mindset Generator | API Integration - Task 10

**A dynamic, client-side web application featuring asynchronous data fetching, Stoic philosophy, and a responsive "Dark Mode" UI.**

### 🔴 **Live Demo:** [Click Here to View](https://sharanx77.github.io/task_10.elevatelabs/)

This project was developed as part of the **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship (Task 10)**. It demonstrates proficiency in consuming public APIs using the Fetch API, handling JSON data, and managing asynchronous JavaScript operations.

## 🚀 About The Project

**"Sigma Mindset Generator"** is a modern implementation of a random quote generator. Designed with a **Stoic/Sigma aesthetic**, it connects to a remote server to retrieve wisdom from ancient philosophers (Seneca, Marcus Aurelius) in real-time.

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Uses the modern `fetch()` API with `async/await` to retrieve data without freezing the UI.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle network failures or API errors.
* **User Feedback Systems:** Implements visual **loading spinners** and button states to inform the user while data is being fetched.
* **Responsive Dark UI:** A mobile-first design featuring a dark, immersive background, gold accents, and typography optimized for readability on all devices.
* **Dynamic DOM Manipulation:** Instantly updates the HTML content with new quotes and authors upon successful retrieval.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project fulfills the requirements of **Task 10: Consume a Public API Using Fetch API**:
1. **API Integration:** Connects to the public **Stoic Quotes API** to fetch random JSON data objects.
2. **JSON Parsing:** Converts raw HTTP responses into usable JavaScript objects to extract specific fields (`text` and `author`).
3. **State Management:** Manages the application state (Loading vs. Idle vs. Error) to toggle visibility of the spinner and quote container.
4. **Network Resilience:** Simulates a production environment by handling edge cases where the API might be down or slow.
